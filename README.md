## Abstract

1. Our objective is to perform a full regression analysis of using a subset of the CDC data set found on https://lionbridge.ai/datasets/10-open-datasets-for-linear-regression/ using the techniques covered in Math/Stat3340. 
    - Some of the data points in the CDC data set have been removed due to insufficient sample size. 
    - Data columns have been removed (indicated in the R code) to better fit our research question. 
    - We have added a new data point to Alabama - this is to ensure that our data set is unique compared to others with the same data set, more reasoning behind this data point is discussed in the data description section. 

2. We would like to answer the following research question: What is the relationship between the people who eat fruits or vegetables less than once a day and obesity and income?

## Introduction

This data analysis project uses techniques of regression analysis to determine what type of relationship exists between obesity rates, geographical region, and income across the 4 regions in the US. We are dividing the regions into the following: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. The states under those regions can be found on the _census.gov_ document in the abstract. Furthermore, each region will be divided into 6 groups depending on income: individuals who make less than $15,000, $15,000 -  $24,999, $25,000 - $34,999, $35,000 - $49,999, $50,000 - $74,999, and $75,000 or greater per year. We will be using the techniques we learned from Math/Stat3340, which includes performing simple/multiple linear regression, calculating maximum likelihood, residual analysis, analysis of variance, etc. These techniques will be discussed further in the methods section.
