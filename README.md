## Abstract

1. Our objective is to perform a full regression analysis of using a subset of the CDC data set found on https://lionbridge.ai/datasets/10-open-datasets-for-linear-regression/. 
    - Some of the data points in the CDC data set have been removed due to insufficient sample size. 
    - Data columns have been removed (indicated in the R code) to better fit our research question. 
    - We have added a new data point to Florida - this is to ensure that our data set is unique compared to others with the same data set. 
    
2. We have also found a separate document which specifies where each of the 50 states (_Note that region 5 includes the Disctict of Colombia but is not included in the CDC data set._) fall under in one of the 4 regions. 
This document can be found on _https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf_

3. We would like to answer the following research question: What is the relationship between the obesity rates, geographical region, and income across the 4 regions in the United States?

## Introduction

This data analysis project uses techniques of regression analysis to determine what kind of relationship exists between obesity rates, geographical region, and income across the 4 regions in the US. We are dividing the regions into the following: Northeast, Midwest, South, and West. The states under those regions can be found on the _census.gov_ document in the abstract. Furthermore, each region will be divided into 5 groups depending on income: individuals who make less than $15,000, $25,000 - $34,999, $35,000 - $49,999, $50,000 - $74,999, $75,000 or greater per year. We will be using the techniques we learned from 3340, which includes performing simple/multiple linear regression, calculating maximum likelihood, residual analysis, etc. More will be explained in the Methods section.

1.Perform least-squares estimation, hypothesis testing and interval estimation for simple linear regression models by hand and using R.
2.Perform least-squares estimation, hypothesis testing and interval estimation for multiplelinear regression models using R.
3.Perform estimation by maximum likelihood and predict new observations using R.
4.Check model adequacy via residual analysis, detection and treatment of outliers and tests for lack of fit.
5.Employ transformations and weighting to correct model inadequacies. 
6.Explore diagnostics for leverage and influence.
7.Understand and be able to address multicollinearity.
8.Select variables and build models using computational techniques.
9.ANOVA.
