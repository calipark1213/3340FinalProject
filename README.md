## Abstract
1. Our objective is to perform a full regression analysis of using a subset of the CDC data set found on https://lionbridge.ai/datasets/10-open-datasets-for-linear-regression/. 
    - Some of the data points in the CDC data set have been removed due to insufficient sample size. 
    - Data columns have been removed (indicated in the R code) to better fit our research question. 
    - We have added a new data point to Florida - this is to ensure that our data set is unique compared to others with the same data set. 
    
2. We have also found a separate document which specifies where each of the 50 states (_Note that region 5 includes the Disctict of Colombia but is not included in the CDC data set._) fall under in one of the 4 regions. 
This document can be found on https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf

3. We would like to answer the following research question: What is the relationship between the obesity rates, geographical region, and income across the 4 regions in the United States?
